    <p class="why"> Why do we call ourselves the dream team?</p>
    <p class="why">We call ourselves the dream team because historically dream team have been teams that were made up of the best and the brightest. Additionally dream teams generally consist of complementary players which is part of what makes them so successful and
        efficient; we are a groups of coders in which all of the necessary or wanted actions can be done well by someone on the team.</p>

        <p>How do we work together? What are our goals?</p>
        <p>As a team we tend to work together very quietly and we get a lot done, however some things that we struggled with were active listening and effective compromise. As a team our goals are to make a successful team website and to make a good website
            for the upcoming client as an extension of the work done on this website. One other major team goal is to retain what we have learned and to use those skills, coding or otherwise in our future endeavors. </p>
